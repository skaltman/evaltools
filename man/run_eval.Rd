\title{Run a complete evaluation in one step}
\usage{
run_eval(
  samples_dir,
  solver_chat,
  system_prompt = NULL,
  tool_names = NULL,
  scorer_chat = ellmer::chat_anthropic(model = "claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929"),
  scorer_instructions = default_judge_instructions(),
  grade_levels = c("I", "C"),
  epochs = 1,
  name = "eval",
  dir = "logs",
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{samples_dir}{Character string path to directory containing YAML sample files.}

\item{solver_chat}{An ellmer Chat object to use for solving samples.}

\item{system_prompt}{Optional character string with system prompt for all samples.
Default is NULL (no system prompt).}

\item{tool_names}{Character vector of tool names to check for in scorer.
If NULL (default), automatically extracts tool names from the dataset's
tool aliases. You only need to specify this if you want to check for
additional tool names beyond what's in the YAML files.}

\item{scorer_chat}{Optional ellmer Chat object for judging. Default uses
Claude Sonnet 4.5.}

\item{scorer_instructions}{Optional custom instructions for the LLM judge.
Default uses standard Correct/Incorrect instructions.}

\item{grade_levels}{Character vector of valid grade levels. Default is
c("I", "C") for Incorrect/Correct.}

\item{epochs}{Number of evaluation epochs. Default is 1.}

\item{name}{Name for the evaluation task. Default is "eval".}

\item{dir}{Directory for logging results. Default is "logs".}

\item{...}{Additional arguments passed to create_solver() (e.g., prompt_field,
setup_field, sleep_time).}
}
\value{
A vitals::Task object with evaluation results already computed.
Access results with \code{task$results} and \code{task$accuracy()}.
}
\description{
Convenience function that creates a task from YAML samples and immediately
runs the evaluation. This is the simplest way to run an eval - just point
it at your samples directory and provide a chat object.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
# Source your tool factories first!
source("R/tool_create_plot.R")

# Run evaluation in one line (tool names auto-detected!)
task <- run_eval(
  samples_dir = "samples/",
  solver_chat = ellmer::chat_anthropic(model = "claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929"),
  system_prompt = "You are a careful analyst."
)

# Results are ready
print(task$results)
print(task$accuracy())
}
